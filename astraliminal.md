Astraliminal
============

A game about perspective, inspired by "Superliminal" by Pillow Castle.

Introduction
------------

The start of the game puts you, the player, on a boat.

The boat is rowing to an island of mystery, fueled by the players desire to learn more of the inner
mysteries of spirituality.

Modern spiritual practicies seem to be empty, but you heard of this mysterious island and its
displays and you want to venture forth into more of the unknown.

But this is no ordinary island. Here, with the proper training and mindset, you will be able to
discover and explore the edges of reality as you know it.

Scene 1
+++++++

You start out on a boat, rowing to the island. A man is rowing the boat and a woman is piloting it.

You ask, "So what's going here?"

She replies, "This is an island of mystery. Not many people are able to comprehend the realities
therein. Dimensions upon dimensions, the result is the same."

You contemplate for a moment. Upon speaking to her again, she merely replies, "We're close to our
destination. Here, all answers will be revealed to you."

You wait and explore. Nothing of interest is to be found.

After a short time, the boat lands at the docks to this island. At least they're sea-faring and
"modern".

She says, "We have finally arrived at your destination. Proceed along the path to meet your fellow
brothers and sisters in the spiritual journey. Many things will be revealed to you, if only you
seek to understand. If not, I can take you back to where you come from."

The player is presented with a choice.

[
    1. Will you procede to the monastery and join the Seekers?
    2. Will you choose to avoid the island and discover mysteries elsewhere?
]

{
    Choose:
    1) The island is presented to you. Follow the path.
    2) Avoid. Seek spiritual discoveries elsewhere.
}

(
    1. GOTO 1.a.
    2. GOTO Z.a.
)

Z.a
^^^

Also known as the Zeta Dimension.

Another island is your destination. An achievement in the game is met, "Explore Other Posibilities",
but in the end, nothing comes from it. It's a nice forest grove with areas to explore, but nothing
of interest suits you. You live in peace and tranquility, learning nothing. Click on an artifact in
the scene to transport you back to the "real world", from which you ultimately came from.

Roll credits.

[[
    Achievement: "Explore Other Posibilities" -- due to choosing this option, the player is led
    to an island of nothing. Beautiful landscape, a sizeable area to explore, but nothing of value
    or interest can be done here. The player can click on a Spiritual Cube to "end' the journey.
    This is the fastest way to end the game, but with nothing achieved.

    Perhaps, this is the best way to start the end of the game. Exploring "nothing" can gain you
    everything, even the the best ending to the game. Start here and move forward? Only you can
    decide.

1.a

You continue to the island which occupies many spiritualities. There are many spiriualities, which
ultimately end up with the same realization.
